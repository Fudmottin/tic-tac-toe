# tic-tac-toe
The game of tic-tac-toe

This is a "vibe code" program. I simply prompted ChatGPT to write it. It is suppose to be in pure C++20.
compile with the following command:

`c++ -std=c++20 -O3 -o tic-tac-toe tic-tac-toe.cpp`

I picked something very simple because I didn't want to spend a lot of time prompting ChatGPT. I
compiled and ran the program and it appears to work. I did not make any manual changes to the
source code. It is as ChatGPT generated it.
